                    Cryptocurrencies are a fast evolving technology, many
                    different wallets were hacked at different times. The only
                    way to keep your cryptocurrency funds safe is the cold
                    storage. Safety requires a solid understanding of what is
                    happening, ideally, you should understand why the cold
                    storage is the only safe option. This is a subject of
                    personal research.
